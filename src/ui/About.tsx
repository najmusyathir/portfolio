                    <p>Originating from a background in PC Building, I discovered my passion for crafting comfortable workstations that inspire productivity. As I delved deeper into this pursuit, I realized my inclination towards a field that could maximize the potential of such setups. This journey led me to the realm of computer science. <br/><br/>My initial foray into coding commenced in 2019 with Python. Exploring its application through mathematical logic, I uncovered a natural affinity for this domain. This revelation prompted a significant shift in my academic trajectoryâ€”from initially considering the medical and health field, I pivoted towards Computer Science, commencing my degree journey in 2021.<br/><br/>

                    The blend of crafting ideal work environments with the problem-solving aspects of computer science resonated deeply with me. It's an exciting intersection where my skills and passions converge, propelling me towards a fulfilling journey in this dynamic field</p>
